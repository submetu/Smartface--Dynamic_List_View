## What is this guide about?
* In some projects, you might have a page in which you are using a [`ListView`](http://ref.smartface.io/#!/api/UI.ListView) component.
* The [`ListViewItems`](http://ref.smartface.io/#!/api/UI.ListViewItem) in the `ListView` component might be dynamic.
* By *Dynamic*, I mean that at runtime, you might have to refresh the `ListView` with a completely new set of `ListViewItems`.
* This is a guide will show you how to create such a dynamic `ListView`.

## How to Run the Project
* Fork this project.
* If you have not already done so, make sure that you have added your smartface SSH key in your github account.

* Create a new workspace using the Smartface Cloud Dashboard ( Choose the "Clone from Git" option and use the SSH key of this project).
* After your workspace has successfully opened, open the integrated terminal using `CTRL + ESC` or go to `View -> Console` in the toolbar of your workspace.
* Navigate to the `/scripts` folder and run `npm install && npm update`.
* Download the latest Smartface Emulator on your smartphone from our [Enterprise Store](http://e.smartface.io).
