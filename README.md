## What is this guide about?
* In some projects, you might have a page in which you are using a [`ListView`](http://ref.smartface.io/#!/api/UI.ListView) component.
* The [`ListViewItems`](http://ref.smartface.io/#!/api/UI.ListViewItem) in the `ListView` component might be dynamic.
* At runtime, you will have to refresh the `ListView` with a new set of `ListViewItems`.
* This is a guide to achieve this.
